"use strict";
//  To try and encourage more sales of different books from a popular 5 book series, a bookshop has decided to offer discounts on multiple book purchases.
//  One copy of any of the five books costs $8.
//  If, however, you buy two different books, you get a 5% discount on those two books.
//  If you buy 3 different books, you get a 10% discount.
//  If you buy 4 different books, you get a 20% discount.
//  If you buy all 5, you get a 25% discount.
//  Note: that if you buy four books, of which 3 are different titles, you get a 10% discount on the 3 that form part of a set, but the fourth book still costs $8.
//  Your mission is to write a piece of code to calculate the price of any conceivable shopping basket (containing only books of the same series), giving as big a discount as possible.
//  2 copies of the first book
//  2 copies of the second book
//  2 copies of the third book
//  1 copy of the fourth book
//  1 copy of the fifth book
//  For a total of $51.60
// [1, 1] = 15.2
// [2, 1] = 23.2
// [2, 2, 2, 1, 1] = 51.60;
// [8, 8, 8, 8, 8] = 240;
